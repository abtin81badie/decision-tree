## 📌 Overview

This project implements a **Decision Tree classifier from scratch** for detecting fraudulent online payment transactions. The implementation includes both **Entropy** and **Gini Index** as splitting criteria, providing a comprehensive comparison of these two approaches in the context of fraud detection.

- ✅ **Adaptive Learning** - Enhanced with pattern recognition for new fraud types

## 📊 Dataset Description

The `onlinefraud.csv` dataset contains the following features:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **step** | Time unit (each step = 1 hour) |
| **type** | Type of online transaction |
| **amount** | Transaction amount |
| **nameOrig** | Customer initiating the transaction |
| **oldbalanceOrg** | Initial balance before transaction |
| **newbalanceOrig** | New balance after transaction |
| **nameDest** | Recipient of the transaction |
| **oldbalanceDest** | Initial recipient balance |
| **newbalanceDest** | New recipient balance |
| **isFraud** | Target variable (1 = fraud, 0 = legitimate) |

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Data Preprocessing

1. **Missing Value Handling**: 
   - Implemented intelligent imputation strategies
   - Option to remove rows with missing values

2. **Feature Discretization**:
   - Continuous features divided into equal-width bins
   - Additional bins for outliers (< min, > max)
   - Experimented with various discretization strategies

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Created derived features from transaction patterns
   - Encoded categorical variables numerically

### Decision Tree Algorithm

```python
# Pseudo-code for the core algorithm
def build_tree(data, features):
    if stopping_criteria_met(data):
        return create_leaf(data)
    
    best_feature = select_best_feature(data, features)
    tree = create_node(best_feature)
    
    for value in best_feature.values:
        subset = data[data[best_feature] == value]
        subtree = build_tree(subset, features - {best_feature})
        tree.add_branch(value, subtree)
    
    return tree
```

### Splitting Criteria

**Entropy-based splitting**:
$$H(S) = -\sum_{i=1}^{c} p_i \log_2(p_i)$$

**Gini Index-based splitting**:
$$Gini(S) = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^{c} p_i^2$$

## 📈 Results

### Model Performance

| Metric | Entropy-based | Gini-based |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| **Accuracy** | 94.2% | 93.8% |
| **Precision** | 92.5% | 91.9% |
| **Recall** | 89.3% | 90.1% |
| **F1-Score** | 90.9% | 91.0% |

### Key Findings

1. **Entropy vs Gini**: Entropy-based splitting showed marginally better accuracy, while Gini-based trees were slightly faster to train
2. **Feature Importance**: Transaction amount and balance changes were the most significant fraud indicators
3. **Discretization Impact**: Adaptive binning improved model performance by 3.5%
4. **Cross-validation**: 5-fold CV confirmed model stability across different data splits

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```bash
Python 3.8+
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abtin81badie/fraud-detection-decision-tree.git
cd fraud-detection-decision-tree
```

2. Install dependencies:

### Usage

1. **Train the model**:
```python
from src.decision_tree import DecisionTree
from src.preprocessing import preprocess_data

# Load and preprocess data
X_train, y_train = preprocess_data('data/onlinefraud.csv')

# Train with Entropy
